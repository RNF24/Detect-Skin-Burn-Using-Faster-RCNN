# Detect-Skin-Burn-Using-Faster-RCNN
It contains the code for detecting skin burn using Faster RCNN

The dataset can be accessed from this link: https://universe.roboflow.com/aibuildersclub/skin-burns-4yoo2/dataset/3#
The format I use is Pascal VOC XML.

Because of the limit of my Google Colab GPU, I can only train until 5 epoch, but you can try it with higher epoch since 5 epoch isn't enough to get the best result.
